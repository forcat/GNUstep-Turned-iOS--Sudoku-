P = followed by num
X = blank				[blank] editable
U = "Users number"		[blank] editable - FOR SAVED GAME?

So; all pre-defined numbers are suffixed with 'P' - ex. 'P5' = 5
all user defined numbers = 'UX'; this allows game saving!

When saved this could be 'U5'; meaning that the user has specified '5' for that box
but as it's user defined; it's still editable.
